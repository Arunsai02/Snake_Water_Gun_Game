#  Snake-Water-Gun Game

---

##  Overview

This is a fun, interactive web-based game inspired by the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" concept, but with a twist! In this version,
the player competes against the computer by choosing between **Snake**, **Water**, or **Gun**. The computer randomly selects its choice,
and the outcome is determined by simple game logic.

This project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and it includes persistent scoring with **localStorage**.
